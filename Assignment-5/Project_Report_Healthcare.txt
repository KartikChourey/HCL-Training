Name : Kartik Chourey
Enrollment Number : 0567AL221025
Branch : AIML


1. Abstract 

The Healthcare Management System is a Java-based web application designed to manage patient information, appointments, billing, and medical records digitally. Traditional healthcare systems rely heavily on paperwork, which leads to inefficiency, data loss, and errors. This project aims to digitize healthcare operations using Java technology and Agile methodology.
